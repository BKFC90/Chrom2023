# For this 'Rouse' model, bonds between adjacent units are specified
# by a harmonic potential centered on the average bond distance, in
# this case 1.0 LJ units.

# The format is [bond number (only 1 in this case)] [strength K]
#                      [equilibrium separation in LJ units]

# Apart from bonds between adjacent units, there are still pair-wise
# interactions between all of them:

# For this first model, the LJ potential is cut off at 1 LJ unit,
# which means that only the repulsive core is retained to keep the
# polymers from intermingling.
