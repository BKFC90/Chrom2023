# For this 'Rouse' model, bonds between adjacent units are specified
# by a harmonic potential centered on the average bond distance, in
# this case 1.0 LJ units.

# The format is [bond number (only 1 in this case)] [strength K]
#                      [equilibrium separation in LJ units]

bond_coeff 1 10 1

# Apart from bonds between adjacent units, there are still pair-wise
# interactions between all of them:

# For thist model, the LJ potential has an attractive tail for A-B
# interactions, but is still cut off for A-A and B-B.

# In specifying interactions, one can use wildcards to select 'all'
# particles, then override for specific cases.
