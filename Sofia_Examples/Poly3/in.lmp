# This third example in a series on polymers intoduces two new components:

# * FENE bond potentials
# * 'soft' interactions

# While a harmonic * (spring) potential wll always keep a repeating
# unit from escaping * its bond, in reality a unit does not stray very
# far from its bond * distance.

# The finite extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential was
# introduced to address this issue.  It has a logarthmic singularity
# at some limiting distance of the bond.

# This can work in numerical simulations (and it was introduced for
# this purpose), but there is a catch:

# The simulation system must be set up in a way that repeat unit
# positions do not exceed the FENE bond limit, or there will be a
# numerical singularity and LAMMPS will crash.

# There is another difficulty in simulating such a system.  Typically
# long polymers are folded up into tight spaces, all the while
# respecting the bond length.  Setting this up as an initial condition
# can be quite challenging.

# As a way to address these issues, one can pre-condition the system
# so that the repeat units are close to their constrained positions.

# We do this with a combination of "soft" potentials and confined initial conditions.

# 1. Soft potentials: unphysical, but serve to guide the system into an
# allowed 'initial' configuration

# 2. Constrained positions: put the repeating units in straight lines
# with very short separations so that they fit into the simulation
# volume.  This is also unphysical, but as the system evolves via the
# soft potentials, the system will reach a point where units have the
# correct separations.

# 1 & 2 are then applied for some 'appropriate' number of time steps,
# and then the 'real' interactions are turned on.
