# define the box here

# set up a simple cubic lattice on which to put the particles
# initially (this avoids having to enter hundreds or thousands of
# positions by hand!)

# we can require a concentration, in this case 0.7 atoms per cubic LJ unit
lattice         sc 0.3

# define a variable temperature

variable T equal 0.75

# set up an interaction volume here (instead of in the init data file)

# first define a region (we can define any number of these)
region          myregion block 0 10 0 10 0 10
# now define the simulation volume to be myregion, with the number of atom types
create_box      1 myregion
# now 'create' the atoms according to the lattice in the box, in this case only 1 type
create_atoms    1 box

# LAMMPS will create a volume containing 5x5x5 = 125 atoms, in a
# volume whose dimensions are scaled such that there is a
# concentration of 0.7 per cubic LJ unit

# we can define masses here as well, one for each type
mass            1 1.0

# as an initial condition, we can give each particle (atom) a random
# initial velocity, corresonding to a temperature T (in this case
# 0.90, in LJ units), and a random number seed (87287)

# velocity        all create $T 87287

# for this example, we will truncate the LJ potential at the edge of the repulsive core, approximating a gas of hard spheres
