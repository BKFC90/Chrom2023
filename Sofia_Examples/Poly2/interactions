# Apart from bonds between adjacent units, there are still pair-wise
# interactions between all of them:

# For thist model, the LJ potential has an attractive tail for A-B
# interactions, but is still cut off for A-A and B-B.

# In specifying interactions, one can use wildcards to select 'all'
# particles, then override for specific cases.
