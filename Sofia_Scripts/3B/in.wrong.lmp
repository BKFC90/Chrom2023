# The next example is a 3-body model.  The init file is a little
# more complicated, and we've introduced repulsion between particles 2
# and 3

# Here and henceforth, lines that were introduced earlier have been

# We must consider boundary conditions.  With fixed boundaries ('f'
# above) the simulation has no meaning outside the box.  If an atom
# wanders outside the box, LAMMPS will halt with a "lost atom" error
# message.  This is the first of typical errors you might get.

# The following 'fix' specifies mirror-like reflection of a trajectory at each wall:

#fix W all wall/reflect xlo EDGE xhi EDGE ylo EDGE yhi EDGE zlo EDGE zhi EDGE

# As an exercise, comment out the fix comment above with a hash mark
# '#' and run LAMMPS.

# For our model, particles 2 and 3 'orbit' particle 1 and have a
# different strength interaction with each other
